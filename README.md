# QWRT-SEQ-20

The Goal of this project is to bring an old-school philosophy of making drum machines as simple to get started and play as possible to web technology. M
Making something that is just one link away from creating something awesome.

16 pads, intuitive keybinding and out of the box sounds is the ultimate goal.

## History 

A lot can be said about physical drum machines, but nothing can be said without mentioning some huge names.

### The MPC Revolution 

### The Roland Underground

### The Huge Market 

## Direct Inspirations 

In design and feel I had to go with what I know best and that is the 16 pad layout. Which I find both easy to use to sequence and intuitive to perform live.

My main hardware inspiration include the mpc2000, the sp404mk2 and many other 16 pad sampler
