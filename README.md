# QWRT-SEQ-20

The Goal of this project is to bring an old-school philosophy of making drum machines as simple to get started and play as possible to web technology. Making something that is just one link away from creating something awesome.

16 pads, intuitive keybinding, of the box sounds and endless creative possibilities is the ultimate goal.

## History 

A lot can be said about physical drum machines, but nothing can be said without mentioning some huge names.

### The MPC Revolution 

### The Roland Underground

### The MIDI companions

### The Huge Market 

## Direct Inspirations 

In design and feel I had to go with what I know best and that is the 16 pad layout. Which I find both easy to use to sequence and intuitive to perform live.

My main hardware inspiration include the mpc2000, the sp404mk2 and many other 16 pad sampler

### Design Choices

The goal is to have the web app look sleek and modern but still have all the information you need in presented in a coherent.
The use should be also able to customize the background of the drum machine to their liking

### Mockups

The basic mockups where first made and then when the design was achieved the design language was followed and additional features where added

there are the initial mockups:

### Technologies Used 

I tried to keep this as minimal as possible

- HTML/CSS/Javascript 
- vanilla JS (no framework)
- all css from scratch 
- Tone.js (third part library for audio processing)
- Sketch: Used to create mockups 


### Code and Resources Used

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) Used for all javascript documentation needs

 - this [solution](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/issues/767) was used to fix the audio not playing when source changed:
